### [JavaScript : more puppy love, less fatigue](https://christianheilmann.com/2018/07/30/javascript-more-puppy-love-less-fatigue/)
> instead of showing people the current form of JavaScript as a matured, highly domesticated and fierce animal, we should get people to know it as a puppy. That’s how I got to know it. Instead of wondering what packages to install and how to set up my server to run it, I wanted to grab it, cuddle it, play with it and — above all — protect it and its surroundings from harm.

I try to approach every new technology the same way - starting from a small subset of the core features, and MVP of sorts. I gradually expand my comprehension of the technology as I move along. If you start the opposite way, you risk approaching the so called phase of “fatigue” that burns many neophyte programmers out.

> Hyperion is a hidden plugin drawer that can easily be integrated into any app. The drawer sits discreetly 🙊 under the app so that it is there when you need it and out of the way when you don't. Hyperion plugins are designed to make inspection of your app quick and simple.

Fisticuffs is a data binding framework for Swift, inspired by [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com) and shares many of the same concepts
```swift
let observable = Observable<String>("")

observable.subscribe { oldValue, newValue in
  print(newValue)
}

observable.value = "Hello, world"
// prints "Hello, world"
```
