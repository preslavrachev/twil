### [JavaScript : more puppy love, less fatigue](https://christianheilmann.com/2018/07/30/javascript-more-puppy-love-less-fatigue/)
> instead of showing people the current form of JavaScript as a matured, highly domesticated and fierce animal, we should get people to know it as a puppy. That’s how I got to know it. Instead of wondering what packages to install and how to set up my server to run it, I wanted to grab it, cuddle it, play with it and — above all — protect it and its surroundings from harm.

> JavaScript these days has matured a lot and will become even better. It can not, though, when we hide its inner workings away from the next generation of developers. You don’t need to be a JavaScript language expert to use it. But it may be a good idea to tell the story how we got to where we are rather than asking people to blindly use what’s on offer right now. It is easy to get disappointed, discouraged and overwhelmed by something new when you use it without understanding it. You also don’t dare to say you don’t get it when your peers all stroke their chins pretending to know everything.

I try to approach every new technology the same way - starting from a small subset of the core features, and MVP of sorts. I gradually expand my comprehension of the technology as I move along. If you start the opposite way, you risk approaching the so called phase of “fatigue” that burns many neophyte programmers out.

### GitHub Projects
#### [willowtreeapps/Hyperion-iOS](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/Hyperion-iOS)
> Hyperion is a hidden plugin drawer that can easily be integrated into any app. The drawer sits discreetly 🙊 under the app so that it is there when you need it and out of the way when you don't. Hyperion plugins are designed to make inspection of your app quick and simple.

### [scoremedia/Fisticuffs](https://github.com/scoremedia/Fisticuffs)
Fisticuffs is a data binding framework for Swift, inspired by [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com) and shares many of the same concepts
```swift
let observable = Observable<String>("")

observable.subscribe { oldValue, newValue in
  print(newValue)
}

observable.value = "Hello, world"
// prints "Hello, world"
```

# Final Notes
For last, I have reserved a small shameless plug. Last week, I started writing on [Steemit](https://steemit.com) and so far, I have posted a couple of things [on my Steemit blog](https://steemit.com/@preslavrachev). So far, I do not want to say whether I like it or not. It's an interesting medium, but way too dominated by the crypto peeps, hungry for tokens more than for quality content. I am not seeing this as a way of monetising my writing at the moment, just as a crude, early version of Reddit/Twitter/Medium/Tumblr that is worth exploring. That's it.
