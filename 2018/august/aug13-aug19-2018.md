# Programming
# Python
Just a simple Python snippet I found [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/brianokken/status/1029880505750171648), which once again affirmed my thoughts on the language making things behave in their simples and most natural way. Wrapping a string from both left and right can't get any easier:

```python
In [2]: 'foobar'.center(21, '=')
Out[2]: '========foobar======='
```
