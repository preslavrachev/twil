# Programming
# Python
Just a simple Python snippet I found [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/brianokken/status/1029880505750171648), which once again affirmed my thoughts on the language making things behave in their simples and most natural way. Wrapping a string from both left and right can't get any easier:

```python
In [2]: 'foobar'.center(21, '=')
Out[2]: '========foobar======='
```

# Books
I have finished reading *[Bad Blood](https://amzn.to/2wa9BKN)*, also known as the story of the rise and unfortunate recent discoveries around [Theranos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos). I also wrote a review [on my blog](https://preslav.me/2018/08/18/book-review-bad-blood/). The book is a must-read.
