### [CURL Logging Interceptor for OKHttp](https://gist.github.com/jgilfelt/42d1c020cc66d3f0a0d7)
For on project of mine, I was looking for a way to streamline the communication between Android and backend engineers, by letting Android export the requests the app makes, using the CURL format. Having the request laid out in CURL, makes it easier to pass it around to a backend engineer, execute directly in the command line, or import into tools like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). In my search, I found this [gist](https://gist.github.com/jgilfelt/42d1c020cc66d3f0a0d7), which seems to be pretty relevant back in 2016, but I am not really sure, if it still is. Need to double-check. I would love to know, if one knows of a better solution.
